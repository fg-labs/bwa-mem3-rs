     * max_ins is a caller-controlled allocation. mem_opt_init() sets 10000 (320

//                   Callers must treat z[]/q_se[] as undefined in this case:
//                   mem_pair() may already have populated z[] before an

//                   path here.
//   extra_flag_out carries the common extra_flag bits (always has 0x1).
//                   On the paired path it is fully assembled and includes
//                   0x2 iff the paired alignment was preferred. On the

//                   for OR-ing in 0x2 itself.
//   n_pri[] is always populated.
//   z[], q_se[] are valid only when *paired_out == 1.
