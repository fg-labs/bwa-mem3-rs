/* Exact banded mate-rescue DP (passes 0 and 1 of the 8-bit kswv rescue path).
 *
 * rescue_prune.h narrows a rescue window to the hull of the K-mer diagonal components whose bound
 * reaches minsc. This file goes further: it runs the pass-0 DP only inside the diagonal BANDS of
 * those components, and reassembles exactly the kswv outputs {score, te, qe, score2} of the hull
 * job from the bands' per-row maxima; pass 1 (start recovery, tb / qb) then runs in a band derived
 * from the pass-0 score (below). mem_matesw_batch_post is unchanged: the parent SeqPair is still
 * the hull window.
 *
 * Why it is exact (test/rescue_band_harness.cpp checks every output field against kswv on the full
 * window, on generated adversarial jobs and on real rescue jobs):
 *  - Every alignment scoring >= tau lies inside ONE diagonal component at threshold tau (the
 *    K-mer bound decays by c per diagonal while a gap excursion costs more per diagonal), and
 *    starts at or after the component's first hit row - (K - 1), and ends by row
 *    i1(tau) = dmaxhit + quanta - 1 + tail(ub, tau) (rescue_prune_params: max(0, ub - tau - 2) at
 *    the default scoring).
 *  - A zero-state DP restricted to any cell set (a band) never exceeds the full DP, and is exact
 *    on every cell of every alignment it contains. So per-row max over bands is <= the true row
 *    max, and equal wherever an alignment scoring >= tau ends. Widening a band (more diagonals,
 *    as grouping lanes into one vector does) keeps both properties, and so does skipping cells that do not
 *    exist in the full DP (query column j < 0 or j >= quanta: the kernel computes, per row, only
 *    the union of its lanes' live columns). The fused (G-based) cells drop an in-row gap run
 *    followed directly by a vertical one; the band then need not match the original cell's
 *    values, but it still holds the full-DP value at the end of every alignment above, because
 *    such an alignment has an equal-scoring twin with the two runs swapped that lies in the same
 *    band (rescue_band.cpp, the note above RB_CELL1).
 *  - Round 1 computes the components at T1 = max(minsc, ub2 / 2) (ub2 = second-largest component
 *    bound at minsc), or at ub1 - delta for a lone near-perfect primary (plan()). The merged
 *    S / te / qe / score2 are exact iff T1 == minsc, or S >= T1 and either score2 >= T1 -- the
 *    termination test --
 *    or the whole hull lies inside the zone [te - Z, te + Z], Z = ceil(S / a) (every row with
 *    R >= minsc is in the hull, so no b[] anchor is out of zone and score2 is -1). Otherwise round 2
 *    computes every component at minsc (skipping those confined to (te - Z, te) with bound < S) and
 *    is exact unconditionally.
 *  - score2 is reproduced from the merged row maxima with kswv's own emulation (lagged rising-row
 *    zeroing, kswv.cpp:~932-936, then the b[] scan, kswv.cpp:~1436-1519); the result
 *    depends only on rows the rule above keeps exact.
 *
 * Pass 1 (tb, qb) of every 8-bit job is banded too (take_pass1 / run_pass1),
 * whether its pass 0 was banded or ran through kswv: the argument below needs only the exact
 * pass-0 (S, te, qe) and the scoring, not the pass-0 components. kswv phase 1 runs the
 * DP on the reversed prefixes ref[te..0] x q[qe..0] and stops at the first row whose max reaches S;
 * tb = te - that row, qb = qe - the first column holding S in it. Every alignment scoring S inside
 * that rectangle ends at (te, qe) (an earlier end row would contradict te being the first row of S
 * in pass 0, an earlier end column in row te the same for qe), so the answer is the start of the
 * score-S alignment A* ending at (te, qe) with the latest start row, then the latest start column.
 * A* with M matches, X mismatches, I inserted and D deleted bases has M + X + I <= qe + 1 (its
 * query span) and scores S <= a M - b X - (gap costs), so a deletion run gives
 * S <= a (qe + 1) - o_del - e_del D and an insertion run S <= a (qe + 1 - I) - o_ins - e_ins I;
 * hence D <= Dmax = max(0, (a (qe + 1) - S - o_del) / e_del), I <= Imax =
 * max(0, (a (qe + 1) - S - o_ins) / (a + e_ins)), and it spans at most qe + 1 + Dmax rows (at the
 * default scoring Dmax = max(0, qe - S - 5) and Imax = Dmax / 2). In reversed
 * coordinates A* starts at (0, 0) and every cell lies on a diagonal r - c in [-Imax, Dmax]. A
 * zero-state DP restricted to that band (cells outside nonexistent: H = E = F = 0) never exceeds
 * kswv's reversed DP and holds S at A*'s end, so it has the same first row reaching S and, in that
 * row, the same first column holding S: tb / qb are byte-identical, ties included. The pad columns
 * [qe + 1, quanta) are in both DPs; they cannot hold S on the first row reaching S (a pad cell's
 * value comes from a row above or, reduced by a gap, from its own row), so they never decide
 * either argmax. The band stops a lane group once every lane has reached its S (gmax cannot exceed
 * S, so nothing after that row changes te or qe), like kswv's KSW_XSTOP freeze. Jobs whose band
 * is not cheaper than kswv, or whose banded max is not S (cannot happen; kept as a guard), run
 * kswv phase 1.
 *
 * Scope: the NEON kernel (aarch64, 16 lanes) and the AVX2 kernel (x86, 32 lanes,
 * rescue_band_kernel_x86.h), for any scoring the kernels take (rb_scoring: the score table
 * {a, -b, -1}, or under --meth the pair group's asymmetric matrix, set_matrix; separate deletion
 * and insertion gap costs), 8-bit: pass 0 for jobs the filter pruned (minsc in [5, 255], plan()),
 * pass 1 for every such job. Without a SIMD kernel the hull path runs.
 * Env: the BWA3_RESCUE_BAND* knobs and BWA3_RESCUE_PRUNE_STATS, listed with their defaults in
 * rescue_env.h.
