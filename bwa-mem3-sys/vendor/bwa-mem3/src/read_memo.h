/* Whole-read-pair memoization ("--dedup-reads").
 *
 * When two input read-PAIRS are byte-identical in both mates' bases, their
 * post-extension alignment regions (mem_alnreg_v) are byte-identical too (proven
 * by the Phase-0 kernel-invariance audit: the alignment kernels are a pure
 * function of read content + index; every id/name/qual/position dependence lives
 * in the replayed SAM stage). So we can run seed->chain->extend once per distinct
 * pair (the REPRESENTATIVE) and copy its regs to the DUPLICATES, then replay the
 * SAM stage per read for byte-identical output.
 *
 * This header exposes only what bwamem.cpp / fastmap.cpp need. The dedup window
 * is one align invocation (the -K chunk): duplicates are collapsed within a
 * chunk only, because the alignment result depends on chunk-scoped state
 * (est_insert_high from per-chunk mem_pestat), which is constant within a chunk
 * but varies across chunks -- so a cross-chunk cache would not be byte-identical.
 *
 * The memoize path (Phase 2): when the controller latches ON (or mode==on), the
 * aligner runs seed->chain->extend only on the REP pairs (compacted at the
 * worker_bwt level; kernels unmodified) and a parallel copy pass replicates each
 * REP's regs into its DUP pairs before pestat/pairing. The per-read SAM stage
 * then replays with each read's own id/name/qual, so output is byte-identical.
 * In auto mode the first chunks measure with the memo OFF (clean align-cost
 * baseline for the controller); the latch turns the copy path on thereafter.
 *
 * The design mirrors the shipped extension-DP dedup controller (BWAMEM3_DEDUP /
 * --dedup, "#415") deliberately: same off|on|auto surface, same net-cycles
 * self-calibrating controller (no user-facing dup-rate threshold), same
 * ends-only word-fingerprint + full-byte-verify, same env-knob family.
