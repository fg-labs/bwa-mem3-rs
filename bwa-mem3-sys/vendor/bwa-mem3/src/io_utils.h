// Single per-call byte cap shared by both the read and the write path. macOS
// rejects any pread()/pwrite() whose count exceeds INT_MAX (2GiB) with EINVAL
// outright -- it is not reported as a short transfer, so the retry loops never
// get a chance and the index build aborts. The meth doubled .pac for a
// human-scale genome is ~3.2GB, which trips this on the write side; the base
// doubled .pac (~1.6GB) stays under it, which is why only --meth failed. Linux
// glibc caps a single read/write at 0x7ffff000 but returns a short count the
// loops already handle. Clamping every request to 1GiB (well under INT_MAX)
// makes both platforms take the short-transfer path. This must NOT be
// "simplified" away. This is the ONE place the cap is defined; the read-side
// fmi_pread_request_size() delegates here too.
