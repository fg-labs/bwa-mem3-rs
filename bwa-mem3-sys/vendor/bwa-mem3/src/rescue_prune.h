/* Exact mate-rescue window pruning.
 *
 * A mate-rescue Smith-Waterman job (mate `q` against reference window `ref`) contributes only
 * score/te/qe (pass 0), tb/qb (pass 1) and score2 (-> csub) to the output, and nothing at all
 * when score < minsc (the post gate fails). This filter proves, from exact K-mer matches, which
 * part of the window can hold any row whose value matters, so the DP can run on a sub-window
 * (or not at all) with byte-identical results.
 *
 * Lemma (a = 1, b = 4, gap open 6 / extend 1; windows and mates without N -- an N breaks the
 * 2-bit 5-mer encoding, so any N makes the filter return RESCUE_PRUNE_FULL -- and the kernel's
 * query-pad columns, which score <= +1, treated as matches): a local alignment scores at most
 *     4 + (#exact 5-mer hits on its cells) - sum over gaps of (2 + |diagonal change|),
 * because a run of r matches holds max(0, r - 4) 5-mers and every mismatch costs 4. Hence an
 * alignment whose diagonals span the interval [d1, d2] scores at most
 *     5 + sum_{d in [d1, d2]} (cnt_d - 1),
 * with cnt_d the number of 5-mer hits on diagonal d = i - j.
 *
 * --meth (rescue_prune_params::set_meth): the filter matches C -> T (OT) or G -> A (OB) converted
 * copies of the window and the mate exactly, which counts every cell the meth matrices score +a or
 * more as a hit (and some more, which only loosens the bound). Under the relation
 * (rescue_prune_params::set_meth_rel; genomic and neutral scoring) a query 5-mer hits every
 * reference 5-mer it relates to base by base -- read T to reference T or C (OT), read A to reference
 * A or G (OB), any other base to itself -- which counts exactly the cells the genomic matrix scores
 * +a (the neutral one's freed cell scores 0 <= a), and every other cell scores -b as before.
 *
 * Other scorings (rescue_prune_params): the same argument with K-mers, K - 1 <= min(b, o_del,
 * o_ins + e_ins) / a (capped at the caller's k_max, at most rescue_prune_scratch_kmax = 8), a
 * per-diagonal charge c and the constant a (K - 1) + c in place of 1 and 5, and the tail below scaled
 * to the deletion costs; rescue_prune_params::from refuses a scoring the argument does not hold for
 * (then every window runs in full). A scoring whose mismatch and gap costs admit K > 5 (-B 6 with
 * the default gaps admits K = 7, -x intractg K = 10, capped at 8) counts longer K-mer hits: every
 * step in K cuts random hits 4x, so the bound keeps fewer rows for the same threshold. --meth takes
 * K > 5 too, on either matching: a K-mer hit is a run of K cells the filter counts as hits, each of
 * which the run's meth matrix scores at most +a (above), and every cell it does not count scores -b
 * (converted copies: a pair unequal after conversion is a real mismatch in every meth matrix; the
 * relation: rescue_meth_rel_matrix_ok), so the same separator costs bound K. At the --meth default
 * scorings (b = 4a genomic / neutral, b = 2a collapsed) that is K = 5 or nothing; -B 5 and up with
 * the default gaps admits more.
 *
 * Two corollaries let the SIMD filters skip work without changing a decision. Every diagonal
 * interval is non-empty and sums a cnt_d - c, so its bound is at most a (K - 1) + c + a hits - c:
 * a job whose total hit count cannot reach minsc is B1 before any diagonal is accumulated (the
 * early B1). And a K-mer hit's row r has every 5-mer of that K-mer in the query, the ones ending
 * at rows r - (K - 5) .. r, so at K > 5 a row is a candidate only if all of those 5-mers are (the
 * chained 5-mer prefilter); the K-mer test itself then decides.
 *
 * Decisions:
 *   RESCUE_PRUNE_B1   no diagonal interval reaches minsc: score < minsc is proven, so the job's
 *                     outputs are dead. The caller does not enqueue it and takes the ordinary
 *                     failing-rescue path instead (MATESW_GAR_PROVEN_FAIL in bwamem_pair.cpp).
 *   RESCUE_PRUNE_B2   rows [*hb, *he] contain every row whose max can reach minsc. A zero-state
 *                     DP started at *hb reproduces all consumed outputs: every alignment scoring
 *                     >= minsc starts at or after the first 5-run of its component (the prefix
 *                     before it nets <= 0), and the tail after its last hit nets <= -(2 + D) per
 *                     gap, which bounds the extent to (last hit diagonal) + quanta - 1 +
 *                     (ub - minsc - 2) at the defaults (rescue_prune_params::tail in general),
 *                     quanta being the 8-bit kernels' query padding, which is at least the
 *                     16-bit kernels' (kswv_quantum.h), so the bound holds on both widths.
 *   RESCUE_PRUNE_FULL no pruning (N present, lengths too short or too long, a scoring or threshold
 *                     the lemma does not hold for -- at the defaults minsc < 5 -- or too many hits
 *                     to be worth it).
 *
 * The bound and extents were validated against the kswv kernel's own per-row maxima on
 * 31.6 M wgs/wes rescue jobs (zero violations) and by whole-run output identity.
