/* fast_reader: content-detecting, gzread-compatible FASTQ byte source.
 *
 * Sniffs the input codec by magic bytes and serves decompressed bytes via a
 * gzread-style API, so the existing kseq parser can sit on top unchanged:
 *
 *   - plain  : raw passthrough
 *   - gzip   : zlib streaming inflate, spanning concatenated members
 *   - bgzf   : libdeflate, one block at a time (the parallel-ready seam)
 *
 * libdeflate's decompress API is one-shot (no streaming), so it is used only
 * for the bounded <=64 KB BGZF blocks; vanilla gzip stays on zlib's streaming
 * inflate. See docs/design for the rationale and the per-arch measurements.
