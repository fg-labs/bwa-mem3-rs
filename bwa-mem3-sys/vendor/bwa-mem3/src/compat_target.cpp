 * Note @SQ AH:* is NOT a field here: bwa-mem2 emits it on generated @SQ

/* --- `bwa-mem`: bwa 0.7.19 -------------------------------------------------
 *
 * @HD:      "@HD\tVN:1.5\tSO:unsorted\tGO:query" (bwa.c:426) -- byte-identical
 *           to bwa-mem3's own default, so this row shares the constant.
 * sidecar:  absent; lh3/bwa#348 was closed unmerged 2025-03-21.
 * MQ:i:     PRESENT (bwamem.c:935) -- this is the field a single compat
 *           boolean could not express, and the reason this table exists.
 * HN:i:     absent; bwa-mem3-only.
 *
 * Pinned at 0.7.19, and the pin matters: bwa gained both the default @HD
 * (6b18630) and MQ:i (d8dd308) in 0.7.18, so a 0.7.17 target would be this
 * row's opposite on those two fields -- and identical to the bwa-mem2 row.
 *
 * This row was unselectable until 0.9.0, on the strength of a measurement
 * (224/63583 differing records) that was retracted as having been taken
 * against a mis-pinned baseline binary. Re-measured, bwa 0.7.19, bwa-mem2
 * v2.2.1 and bwa-mem3 agree byte-for-byte on alignment records once the
 * additive tags are removed. Auditing 0.7.17..0.7.19 says that is structural
 * rather than incidental: the only output-affecting changes in that range are
 * the two additive items above plus the opt-in -u/-z flags -- nothing touches
 * seeding, chaining, extension, pairing, MAPQ or dedup. So bwa-mem2's
 * "identical to bwa-mem 0.7.17" carries forward to 0.7.19, and bwa-mem2 parity
 * is bwa parity.
 *
 * That audit holds for the DEFAULT path, and the bench harness's strict
 * bwa-parity arm has cleared it empirically there. It does not hold once
 * min_chain_weight > 0: `mem_chain_flt`'s all-chains-dropped case is a real
 * record on which bwa and bwa-mem2 disagree about the alignment itself
 * (fg-labs/bwa-mem3#310), which is what `chain_flt_resurrect_empty` below
 * models. Measured on 9 150 bp phix reads at -W 200: bwa leaves all 9
 * unmapped, bwa-mem2 (and bwa-mem3 before #310) aligns all 9.
 *
 * So the old note here -- "at most one of these two targets can be
 * byte-identical, and no such record has been observed" -- was true only
 * because nothing had looked at -W or the -x long-read presets. Now that a row
 * can model the difference, both targets can be right at once. What is still
 * unaudited is the REST of that preset space: 0.7.17..0.7.19 was audited for
 * output-affecting changes on the default path, and nothing exercises
 * -x pacbio/pbref/ont2d end to end against bwa. */
