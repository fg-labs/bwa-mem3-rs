 * newline), or NULL — emitted verbatim after the @SQ block so a -R read
 * group lands as an @RG header, matching the default (non-meth) writer.

 * or NULL: its @SQ identity tags (M5/UR/AS/SP) are merged into the @SQ for
 * each contig whose SN and LN both match (an LN mismatch means a
 * stale/foreign sidecar and is skipped), and its @CO/@PG/@RG records are
