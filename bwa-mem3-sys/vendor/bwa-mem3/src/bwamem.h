 *
 * Note the skip floor is an absolute count while the vote budget is not: a
 * 150 bp read offers ~145 6-mers and a 75 bp read ~70, so the same 10 votes is
 * twice as harsh a test on short reads. Measured skip rates bear this out --

// Output contract:
//   * paired_out: set to 1 iff the paired branch was taken; 0 otherwise.
//     Callers must always inspect *paired_out before reading z[] / q_se[].
//   * z[], q_se[]: valid only when *paired_out == 1. On the no-pairing path
//     they must be treated as undefined — mem_pair() can populate z[]
//     before the is_multi early return, so their contents do not signal
//     anything when *paired_out == 0.
//   * extra_flag_out: on the paired path it is fully assembled (and
//     includes 0x2 iff the paired alignment was preferred); on the
//     no-pairing path it is only partial — the caller (or mem_sam_pe's
//     no_pairing emission block) is responsible for OR-ing in 0x2 itself.
//   * n_pri[]: always populated.
//
// Returns the number of mate-rescue hits produced (same meaning as the
