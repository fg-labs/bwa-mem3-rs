/* Anti-diagonal (wavefront) SIMD ksw_global2 kernels.

 * Each SIMD tier (selected by target macros) compiles an int32 kernel
 * (ksw_g2_wave) and, on tiers that support it, a narrower int16 kernel
 * (ksw_g2_wave16) with twice the lanes. Both are byte-identical to the scalar
 * ksw_global2 (see the LEMMA 1-10 proof of byte-identity below): the int16
 * recurrence is the same, only the element width differs, and it is entered
 * only where ksw_g2_wave16_safe proves the whole H/E/F range fits int16. The
 * dispatcher in ksw.cpp uses a SIMD path only for m==5, a CIGAR request, and
 * w >= the tier's width crossover (perf gate; every path is byte-identical so
 * the choice never changes output — it only picks the fastest safe kernel). */
/*=============================================================================
 * PROOF OF BYTE-IDENTICAL OUTPUT: ksw_g2_wave  ==  ksw_global2_scalar
 *=============================================================================
 * Claim: for every feasible input with qlen>=1 and w >= |tlen-qlen|+3 (the
 * band-width floor guaranteed by every production caller, see bwa.cpp), the
 * anti-diagonal SIMD kernel ksw_g2_wave (NEON/AVX2/AVX-512 -- same recurrence
 * and boundary logic, differing only in vector width and intrinsic spelling)
 * returns a score, n_cigar and cigar[] byte-identical to ksw_global2_scalar.
 * The proof is empirically gated by test/unit/test_ksw_global2_wave.cpp
 * (differential parity vs the scalar oracle on randomized + edge inputs).
 *
 * Notation. H/E/F/d are the usual banded-Gotoh cells; M(i,j)=H(i-1,j-1)+S(i,j)
 * is the diagonal (match/mismatch) candidate. Scalar's row band is
 * beg(i)=max(0,i-w), end(i)=min(qlen,i+w+1). The wavefront visits anti-
 * diagonals s=i+j in increasing order; on diagonal s its in-band row range is
 * iS(s)=max(0,s-(qlen-1),ceil((s-w)/2)), iE(s)=min(tlen-1,s,floor((s+w)/2)),
 * coded as (s-w+1)>>1 and (s+w)>>1. Rolling buffers Hb/Eb/Fb (ring size 3/2/2
 * over s, indexed by row i with a fixed store offset i+1) hold H/E/F; z[]/
 * zoff[]/ziS[] hold direction bytes in diagonal-major layout.
 *
 * LEMMA 1 (recurrence locality). H,E,F,d at (i,j) are a pure function of
 * exactly three predecessors: H(i-1,j-1) (diagonal), E(i,j) (produced by row
 * i-1, same column, via the E-threading store), and F(i,j) (produced by
 * column j-1, same row, via the F-threading store). Each predecessor has
 * strictly smaller i+j. Anti-diagonal order (wavefront) and row-major order
 * (scalar) are both linear extensions of this dependency DAG, so by induction
 * on s=i+j both compute the identical mathematical H/E/F/d at every cell,
 * independent of evaluation order.
 *
 * LEMMA 2 (score lookup fidelity). The SIMD table lookup (2-level vpshufb /
 * vqtbl2 / vpermb over the flattened `mat` bytes, indexed by target[i]*m+
 * query[j], sign-extended via shift-left-24/shift-right-24) returns exactly
 * mat[target[i]*m+query[j]], the same int8_t scalar's query-profile q[j]
 * yields, sign-extended the same way by C's usual arithmetic conversions.
 * AVX2's reversed-query buffer and NEON's rev4 only change how the byte is
 * *loaded* (for contiguous SIMD access), never its value.
 *
 * LEMMA 3 (direction-byte identity). Given identical inputs (Lemma 1), both
 * kernels run the identical 4-comparison chain with identical tie-breaks:
 * origin = (M>=E)?0:1, overridden to 2 if !(max(M,E)>=F); E-extend flag set
 * iff (E-e_del) > (M-oe_del); F-extend flag set iff (F-e_ins) > (M-oe_ins).
 * The wavefront's mm/e/h_me/h/t1/em/Ecur/t2/fm/Fcur variables are the exact
 * same int32 add/sub/max ops as scalar's m/e/h/f/t; hence d, H, E, F are
 * bit-identical cell-for-cell.
 *
 * LEMMA 4 (boundary seeding equivalence). Scalar's eh[] init (eh[0].h=0;
 * eh[j].h=-(o_ins+e_ins*j) for 1<=j<=w, else MINUS_INF; eh[j].e=MINUS_INF
 * always) and its implicit column h1=-(o_del+e_del*(i+1)) at beg==0 are
 * reproduced exactly by the wavefront's i==0 and j==0 lane overrides (Hi0,
 * Hj0, applied j0m-then-i0m so cell (0,0) resolves to 0), by the freset mask
 * (F reset to MINUS_INF at j==beg(i), matching scalar's per-row f=MINUS_INF),
 * and by evalid's i>=1 guard (E undefined at row 0, matching eh[j].e init).
 *
 * LEMMA 5 (band-region equivalence). {(i,j): 0<=i<tlen, 0<=j<qlen, beg(i)<=j
 * <end(i)} equals {(i,s-i): iS(s)<=i<=iE(s)} exactly: j>=i-w <=> i<=floor((s+w)/2)
 * and j<=i+w <=> i>=ceil((s-w)/2), combined with 0<=i<tlen and 0<=j<qlen --
 * algebraically identical to the iS/iE formulas. No cell is computed by one
 * kernel and skipped by the other.
 *
 * LEMMA 6 (band monotonicity / column persistence). beg(i),end(i) are
 * nondecreasing in i, so once column j exits the band it never re-enters.
 * Hence at any row i where column j is in-band, eh[j].e read at that row is
 * either the real E value row i-1 produced (if (i-1,j) was in-band) or the
 * untouched MINUS_INF init (iff row i is column j's first entry). The
 * wavefront's evalid mask ((i-1,j) in scalar band, derived the same way as
 * Lemma 5) selects precisely between these two cases.
 *
 * LEMMA 7 (ring-buffer indexing correctness). The fixed store offset (+1
 * relative to the producing row) makes Hd2[i]=H(i-1,j-1), Ep1[i]=E(i,j) (per
 * Lemma 6), Fp1[i+1]=F(i,j) exactly the predecessors Lemma 1 requires. Since
 * an in-band cell's diagonal/E/F predecessors are themselves in-band or an
 * explicitly-overridden boundary lane (Lemmas 4-5), stale values left in
 * unread out-of-band ring slots are never read by an in-band cell.
 *
 * LEMMA 8 (interior fast-path equivalence). The interior chunk-skip branch
 * fires only when i0>iS(s) and i0+lanes-1<iE(s); this implies every lane in
 * the chunk has i>=1, j=s-i>=1, and is fully in-band, so i0m, j0m, freset are
 * always false and evalid/inband always true -- exactly the conditions under
 * which the general branch reduces to the interior branch's unconditional
 * loads. The split is a pure throughput optimization with no semantic effect.
 *
 * LEMMA 9 (final score, last-write-wins). Column j=qlen-1 is visited at
 * diagonal s=i+(qlen-1), strictly increasing in i in both orderings; the last
 * write in both is therefore at i=tlen-1 (feasible by the caller's w floor),
 * so both capture H(tlen-1,qlen-1) as the final score. Precondition qlen>=1
 * (the sole production call shape) makes this capture reachable; the tlen==0
 * corner reduces identically in both to the closed-form -(o_ins+e_ins*qlen).
 *
 * LEMMA 10 (backtrack trajectory identity). Both backtrack loops start at the
 * textually identical cell (tlen-1, min(tlen-1+w,qlen-1)) and apply the
 * textually identical transition which = d>>(which<<1)&3 against the *same*
 * d-byte (Lemmas 3+7), pushing ops via the same shared push_cigar. By
 * induction on backtrack steps the full (i,k,op) trajectory is identical,
 * so the pushed op/len sequence, the identical trailing appends, and the
 * identical reversal loop yield byte-identical n_cigar and cigar[].
 *
 * THEOREM. Lemmas 1-10 compose: for qlen>=1 and w>=|tlen-qlen|+3, ksw_g2_wave
 * and ksw_global2_scalar produce identical (score, n_cigar, cigar[]) on every
 * feasible input, for all three arch variants.
 *
 * OUT OF SCOPE. Infeasible bands (w < |tlen-qlen|+3, where scalar may return
 * MINUS_INF or an incomplete band) are unreachable -- every production caller
 * enforces the w floor -- and are explicitly excluded; the kernels are only
 * asserted to differ, if at all, in that unreachable regime. qlen==0 is
 * likewise excluded (no production call site passes an empty query); the
 * wavefront's qlen==0 score default is a formality, not a proven-equal case.

/* --- AVX-512 int16 kernel: 32 lanes (vs the int32 kernel's 16), for the narrow-
 * to-moderate bands where 16-lane int32 has not yet reached its crossover. Entered
 * only when ksw_g2_wave16_safe proves every H/E/F stays in int16 range, so it is
 * byte-identical to the int32 scalar; otherwise the dispatcher falls back to the
 * int32 wave or scalar (both already byte-identical). Structure mirrors the int32
 * AVX-512 kernel exactly at half the element width. jv is derived from the scalar
 * (s-i0), not from s, because s=i+j can exceed int16 range on long reads even when
 * i and j individually do not. Crossover: 32-lane int16 beats scalar from w~8 and
 * overtakes the 16-lane int32 kernel at w>=16 (measured on Sapphire Rapids,
 * clang-19, 150bp/b=4). WMIN=10 keeps a comfortable margin on the weaker non-VBMI
 * table-lookup path (VBMI is faster at the low end). */

/* --- AVX2 int16 kernel: 16 lanes (vs the int32 kernel's 8), for the narrow-to-
 * moderate bands where 8-lane int32 has not yet reached its crossover. Entered
 * only when ksw_g2_wave16_safe proves every H/E/F stays in int16 range, so it is
 * byte-identical to the int32 scalar; otherwise the dispatcher falls back to the
 * int32 wave or scalar (both already byte-identical). Structure mirrors the int32
 * AVX2 kernel exactly at half the element width (pre-reversed query buffer, 2-level
 * vpshufb table, bitwise select). jv is derived from the scalar (s-i0), not from
 * s, because s=i+j can exceed int16 range on long reads even when i,j do not.
 * Crossover: 16-lane int16 only overtakes the 8-lane int32 kernel at wide bands
 * (w>=33 on Sapphire Rapids, clang-19, 150bp/b=4); in the w~20-32 band int32 is
 * ~1% faster, so WMIN=33 keeps int16 to the region where it is a clear net win. */

/* --- NEON int16 kernel: 8 lanes (vs the int32 kernel's 4), for the narrow-to-
 * moderate bands where 4-lane int32 could not beat scalar. Entered only when
 * ksw_g2_wave16_safe proves every H/E/F stays in int16 range, so it is byte-
 * identical to the int32 scalar; otherwise the dispatcher falls back to the
 * int32 wave or scalar (both already byte-identical). Structure mirrors the
 * int32 kernel exactly at half the element width; no 2x unroll (the int32
 * experiment showed the ceiling is the diagonal recurrence, not intra-diagonal
 * ILP). jv is derived from the scalar (s-i0), not from s, because s=i+j can
 * exceed int16 range on long reads even when i and j individually do not.
 * Crossover: the 8-lane int16 kernel becomes a net win over scalar from w~16
 * (measured on Graviton4, clang-19, 150bp/b=4); narrower bands stay scalar, so
 * WMIN=16. */
