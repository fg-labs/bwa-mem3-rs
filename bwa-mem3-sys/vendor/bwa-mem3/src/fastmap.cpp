     *             measured from Sproc_wall against ramp slice count.

     * Those pull in opposite directions and the third is easy to forget: at low
     * -t stalls are impossible and overhead rules, so few large slices win; at
     * high -t the stall ceiling binds and the ratio must stay under it.

     * A cost model over those three terms suggested r=1.80, and measurement

     * where no stall was possible to begin with.
     *
     * The absolute first slice is a WASH on this input at every rung -- -0.005 /
     * -0.012 / -0.017 s in the ramp terms, and inside the run-to-run spread end to
     * end. It is here for what the table shows about how the fractional form
     * SCALES, not for a speedup. Sizing the first slice as task_size/ratio^depth
     * makes it grow with -t, because task_size is chunk_size * n_threads, and the
     * measured head fill tracks that exactly: 0.051 -> 0.099 -> 0.199 s across
     * -t 16 -> 32 -> 64, doubling with every rung. The absolute form is flat at
     * 0.081 -> 0.087 -> 0.095 s. Extending the same arithmetic, -t 128 would open
     * a 1280 Mbase cohort with a 76 Mbase slice and ~0.37 s of wholly unhidden
     * fill. Fill and overhead are both absolute costs, so nothing about the right
     * first slice scales with the cohort; the fractional form only looked free
     * because it was never measured above -t 64.
     *
     * The honest cost of pinning it: at -t 64 the absolute slice needs one extra
     * ramp slice (7 vs 6), and that +0.068 s of kt_for overhead eats most of the
     * 0.104 s of head fill it saves. That trade gets better with -t, since fill
     * would keep doubling while the per-slice cost does not.
     *
     * Deriving the ratio at run time from the ramp's own slices was implemented
     * and rejected. Beyond a sign error, it is not robust: the estimate must come
     * from the small early slices, which under-report compute throughput because
     * fixed kt_for costs dominate, and its outcome at -t 64 flips sign on whether
     * step 1 is one or two slices behind step 0 -- a scheduling artifact, not
     * something a policy can pin. A fixed pair is deterministic and measured
