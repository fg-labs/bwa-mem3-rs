/* src/compat_target.h — `--compat` output-compatibility targets.
 *
 * A compat target describes the exact SAM/BAM output shaping needed to
 * reproduce another aligner's byte stream. It is DATA, not control flow: the
 * table in compat_target.cpp holds one row per target, and every consumer reads
 * a field off the selected row instead of testing a flag bit. Adding a target
 * is a new row.
 *
 * A single boolean would not do. bwa and bwa-mem2 diverge from each other on
 * the very fields this shapes -- bwa emits MQ:i and a default @HD, bwa-mem2
 * emits neither -- so "compat" is a choice among targets, not an on/off switch.
 *
 * Compat targets shape OUTPUT. Almost every field here is header or tag
 * shaping and changes no alignment, no score and no flag -- and that remains
 * the rule a new field should expect to follow.
 *
 * The exception is `chain_flt_resurrect_empty`, and it exists because the rule
 * and the purpose collide: on that one path bwa and bwa-mem2 emit DIFFERENT
 * ALIGNMENTS for the same read, so a target that refused to model it would
 * reproduce neither faithfully. `--compat=bwa-mem` that returns bwa-mem2's
 * alignments is not a weaker guarantee, it is a false one. A row therefore
 * records whichever behavior ITS target has, alignment-affecting or not.
 *
 * This does not license `--fast` or `--proper-pair-from-emitted` into a row:
 * those deviate from BOTH targets, so asking for target parity and for a
 * deviation from it in one command stays incoherent, and main_mem still
 * rejects the pair. See docs/src/whats-different/equivalence.md.
