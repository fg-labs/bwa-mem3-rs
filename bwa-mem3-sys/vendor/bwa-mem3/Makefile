# ---- Compiler version floor -------------------------------------------------
# bwa-mem3's shipping and benchmarked builds use clang-19 (bioconda forces
# clang; the performance benchmark suite builds with clang-19). Older toolchains
# produce materially slower binaries: clang-19 is ~5% faster than gcc-15 and
# ~15%+ faster than gcc-11 on ARM (~5-16% on x86), because older compilers emit
# redundant SIMD ops (e.g. extra blend mask-broadcasts) that a modern clang
# already elides. To keep an accidentally-slow build from being mistaken for
# bwa-mem3 being slow, a bare `make` on a below-floor compiler FAILS. Deliberate
# builds on old toolchains (packagers on older distros, compatibility CI, A/B
# tests) opt out with ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED_COMPILER=1.

# Thresholds are overridable (?=) so a distro/packager can set its own policy.

# 24.04) trips the parse-time $(error) below and aborts — breaking both
# contributor cleanups and any CI step that runs `make clean` before a build
# with a pinned CXX (e.g. the kswv ASan steps in proto-neon-kswv.yml, which
# `make clean` bare, then `make ... CXX="ccache clang++-19"`). Enforce only when

# Kernel TUs (bandedSWA, kswv, ksw, sam_encode) are compiled per-tier on x86

	# GCC + Docker BuildKit jobserver workaround (fg-labs/bwa-mem3#121).
	#
	# Symptom: under BuildKit `make lto-build` dies with
	#   make[2]: *** write jobserver: Bad file descriptor.  Stop.
	#   lto-wrapper: fatal error: make returned 2 exit status
	# linux/arm64 happens to dodge it; linux/amd64 reproduces every time.
	#
	# Root cause: GNU make 4.3's jobserver uses a pair of pipe FDs the parent
	# make advertises in MAKEFLAGS. The chain that breaks under BuildKit is
	# `make[1]` → `gcc -flto` → `lto-wrapper` → `make[2]`. GCC's hygienic
	# subprocess infrastructure sets FD_CLOEXEC on inherited file descriptors
	# it doesn't recognize as compiler-relevant, which closes the jobserver
	# FDs before lto-wrapper's `make[2]` can see them. `make[2]` reads
	# MAKEFLAGS, finds the FD numbers, tries to write to them, and dies on
	# EBADF. This is a known GNU make 4.3 limitation;
	# `--jobserver-style=fifo` (GNU make 4.4+) would survive the chain by
	# using a named FIFO instead of FDs, but Debian Bookworm — and therefore
	# the bwa-mem3-bench Dockerfile's base image — ships make 4.3.
	#
	# Tried and rejected:
	#   - `-flto=auto`: still attempts jobserver negotiation on GCC 12.
	#   - `-flto=N` alone: lto-wrapper still spawns a sub-make that inherits
	#     MAKEFLAGS via the GCC env.
	#   - Clearing MAKEFLAGS for the recursive make `+` `-j$N`: the recursive
	#     make freshly opens its own jobserver FDs in its process, but those
	#     FDs still get CLOEXEC'd by GCC during the LTO link step, so
	#     lto-wrapper's make[2] still hits EBADF.
	#
	# Fix that works: drive the recursive make with `-j1` so it does NOT
	# advertise a jobserver in MAKEFLAGS at all. With nothing advertised,
	# lto-wrapper's make[2] doesn't try to inherit one — it uses the
	# parallelism level requested by `-flto=$$LTO_JOBS` directly, via its
	# own freshly-opened FDs scoped to the lto-wrapper process tree. The
	# inner compile phase goes serial (~5 min cost on a bench-fleet build);
	# the LTO link phase, which dominates LTO build time, stays parallel.
	# Acceptable trade-off for a per-SHA one-shot build.
	#
	# When BuildKit is not in the picture (local dev, traditional CI) the
	# -j1 inner compile is the same single-fork-per-recipe-line behavior
	# `make all -j1` would have produced — no behavioral regression vs.
	# running `make lto-build` without -j on the outer level. The fix only
	# changes the parallelism breakdown, not the build product.
	#
	# Clang's `-flto=thin` branch is unaffected — ThinLTO uses its own
	# parallelism, not the GNU make jobserver, and never participated in
	# the FD inheritance dance.
